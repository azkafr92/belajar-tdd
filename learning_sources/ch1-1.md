# Red-Green-Refactor

![ltdd_0101](ltdd_0101.png)

**Red**. We write a failing test (including possible compilation failures). We run the test suite to verify the failing tests.

**Green**. We write just enough production code to make the test green. We run the test suite to verify this.

**Refactor**. We remove any code smells. These may be due to duplication, hardcoded values, or improper use of language idioms (e.g., using a verbose loop instead of a built-in iterator). If we break any tests during refactoring, we prioritize getting them back to green before exiting this phase.
